## Release v1.1 - program will ask for speed, distance, and forward/backward direction values for the linear motion.
### The settings/dependencies are made in CMakeLists.txt and package.xml, which can be directly used with the help of git pull of this repository.

## Release v1.2 - program will ask for the values of angular velocity (degree/secs), angle (degrees), and angle orientation (clockwise/anti-clockwise.)
### All other settings/dependencies (of CMakeLists.txt and package.xml) will remain same as per previous v1.0.
